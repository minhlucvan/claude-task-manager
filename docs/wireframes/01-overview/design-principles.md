# Design Principles - "Simple by Default, Smart by Design"

## Vision: Seamless Human-AI Collaboration

Transform development from context-poor handoffs to intelligent partnership where humans focus on strategy, AI handles execution, and context flows automatically.

**Success Measure**: _"My AI partner understands my project better than I can explain it."_

## Core Principles

### 1. Context-First

Every design decision serves rich context flow between human strategy and AI execution.

### 2. Simple by Default

Start with what humans need right now. Hide complexity until needed.

### 3. Smart by Design

AI intelligence anticipates needs, suggests next steps, learns from patterns.

### 4. Emotional Comfort

Warm language, clear progress, psychological safety. "Working On" not "Tasks".
