# User Flows & Journey Mapping

## Core Philosophy: Context-Aware Human-AI Collaboration

This document outlines user flows for **Claude Task Manager** - a context-aware human-AI collaboration system where humans provide strategic direction and AI agents execute with complete project understanding. Every flow is designed around optimal information transfer between human insight and AI capability.

**Fundamental Flow Pattern:**

```
Human Direction → Context Package → AI Execution → Context Enrichment → Strategic Feedback
```

## Primary User Journeys

**The Golden Path: Human Strategy → AI Execution**

**Entry Points:**

- "Right Now" dashboard (current task focus)
- AI Helper with conversation history
- Task Master integration with PRD parsing
- Research-backed task generation

**Core Handoff Flow:**

```
Human: Strategic Decision → Context Package Creation → AI: Implementation
    ↓                           ↓                        ↓
Product Vision        →    Complete Project Context  →  Autonomous Building
Architecture Choice   →    Implementation Guidance   →  Pattern Following
