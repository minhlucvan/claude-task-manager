## Migration Summary

The content from these original files has been reorganized and distributed across the new structured documentation system as follows:

### Content Distribution Map

**From ux-proposals.md:**

- Executive Summary & Philosophy → `01-overview/design-principles.md`
- Layout Architecture → `02-layouts/app-layout.md`
- UI Components → `02-layouts/component-grid.md`
- Visual Flow States → `04-interactions/microinteractions.md`
- Mobile Design → `05-responsive/mobile-adaptations.md`
- Technical Architecture → `06-implementation/component-specs.md`

**From ux-proposals-v2.md:**

- Task Detail Page → `03-features/task-management/task-detail-page.md`

**Additional Content Added:**

- `01-overview/user-flows.md` - Comprehensive user journey mappings
- `01-overview/information-architecture.md` - Content organization strategy
- `02-layouts/page-templates.md` - Reusable layout patterns
- `04-interactions/keyboard-shortcuts.md` - Power user feature specifications
- `04-interactions/drag-drop-behaviors.md` - Interaction behavior specifications
- `README.md` - Master navigation and implementation guide

**Enhanced Details:**

- Accessibility considerations throughout all documents
- Performance optimization requirements
- Error handling specifications
- Testing strategies and requirements
- Progressive enhancement patterns

## Usage Notes

These archived files should be referenced when:

- Understanding the original design thinking and rationale
- Comparing the evolution from initial concepts to structured specifications
- Reviewing historical design decisions and their context
- Training new team members on the design process evolution

The structured documentation system in the parent directory should be used for:

- Current design and development work
- Implementation planning and execution
- Cross-functional team collaboration
- Ongoing design system maintenance
