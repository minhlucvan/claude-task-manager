# 🚀 Versioning Strategy

This document outlines our high-level versioning strategy and principles for the PayDirection API Services project.

---

## 📋 Overview

Our versioning strategy follows **semantic versioning** with a structured prerelease flow designed to ensure quality and stability across development, pre-production, and production environments.

### 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Manual Control**: All releases are manually triggered to prevent unintended deployments
2. **Semantic Versioning**: We follow semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with prerelease identifiers
3. **Environment Progression**: Clear path from development → pre-production → production
4. **Quality Gates**: Multiple validation stages before production deployment

---

## 🔄 Version Flow Strategy

### Primary Release Flow

```
Beta (Development) → Release Candidate (PPE) → Production
v1.50.0-beta.1 → v1.50.0-rc.1 → v1.50.0
```

### Alternative Release Flow

For hotfixes or simple releases:

```
Direct Production Release
v1.50.0 → v1.50.1
```

## 🎯 Release Environments & Deployment Strategy

| Environment              | Version Pattern  | Purpose                                    | Deployment Trigger      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Development**          | `v*-beta.*`      | Feature development & integration testing  | Beta version tags       |
| **Pre-Production (PPE)** | `v*-rc.*`        | User acceptance testing & final validation | Release candidate tags  |
| **Production**           | `v*` (no suffix) | Live customer environment                  | Production version tags |

## 🏷️ Version Types & Use Cases

### 🧪 Beta Versions (`v1.50.0-beta.1`)

- **Purpose**: Development and initial testing
- **Audience**: Internal development team
- **Stability**: Experimental, may contain bugs
- **Environment**: Development only

### 🚀 Release Candidates (`v1.50.0-rc.1`)

- **Purpose**: Pre-production validation
- **Audience**: QA team, stakeholders
- **Stability**: Feature-complete, minimal bugs expected
- **Environment**: Pre-production (PPE)

### ✅ Production Releases (`v1.50.0`)

- **Purpose**: Customer-facing releases
- **Audience**: End users, customers
- **Stability**: Fully tested and validated
- **Environment**: Production

### 🔥 Hotfix Releases (`v1.50.1`)

- **Purpose**: Critical bug fixes
- **Audience**: End users requiring urgent fixes
- **Stability**: Minimal change, focused fix
- **Environment**: Direct to production (expedited)

## 🎨 Semantic Versioning Rules

### Version Components

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]
  │     │     │         │
  │     │     │         └─ Optional: beta.1, rc.1, etc.
  │     │     └─ Bug fixes, security patches
  │     └─ New features, backward compatible
  └─ Breaking changes, major updates
```

### Increment Guidelines

| Change Type          | Version Bump | Example                    | When to Use                   |
| -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Breaking Changes** | Major        | `1.49.6` → `2.0.0`         | API changes, removed features |
| **New Features**     | Minor        | `1.49.6` → `1.50.0`        | New endpoints, enhancements   |
| **Bug Fixes**        | Patch        | `1.49.6` → `1.49.7`        | Security fixes, bug repairs   |
| **Prerelease**       | Prerelease   | `1.50.0` → `1.50.0-beta.1` | Testing versions              |

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance Strategy

### Validation Gates

Each release type has specific validation requirements:

#### Beta Release Gates

- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Basic integration tests
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Feature flag validation

#### Release Candidate Gates

- [ ] All test suites passing
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

#### Production Release Gates

- [ ] RC validation completed
- [ ] Stakeholder approval
- [ ] Deployment runbook ready
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

---

## 🔄 Release Cadence & Planning

### Regular Release Schedule

- **Beta Releases**: As needed for development iterations
- **Release Candidates**: Weekly for major features
- **Production Releases**: Bi-weekly (or as needed)
- **Hotfixes**: Emergency only

### Feature Release Planning

1. **Planning Phase**: Define scope and version target
2. **Development Phase**: Create beta versions for testing
3. **Validation Phase**: Release candidates for QA
4. **Production Phase**: Final release with monitoring

---

## 🚨 Emergency Release Strategy

### Hotfix Process

For critical production issues:

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Severity and impact evaluation
2. **Fast-Track Development**: Direct patch development
3. **Minimal Testing**: Essential validation only
4. **Expedited Deployment**: Direct to production
5. **Post-Release Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring and validation

### Rollback Strategy

- **Automatic Rollback**: For deployment failures
- **Manual Rollback**: For functionality issues
- **Partial Rollback**: Feature flag disabling
- **Data Migration Rollback**: Database-specific procedures

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Release Quality Metrics

- **Deployment Success Rate**: Target 99%+
- **Rollback Rate**: Target <5%
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Target <30 minutes
- **Security Incident Rate**: Target 0

### Development Velocity Metrics

- **Release Frequency**: Track release cadence
- **Lead Time**: Feature to production time
- **Beta to Production Time**: Validation cycle efficiency
