# Feature Idea: Intelligent Notes System - Knowledge Management for Development Projects

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive knowledge management system that transforms how development teams capture, organize, and leverage project knowledge. The system provides **"Smart by Design, Simple by Default"** - an intuitive interface backed by powerful AI-driven intelligence that creates contextual connections, tracks decision impact, and surfaces relevant knowledge exactly when needed.

## Core Philosophy: Smart by Design, Simple by Default

Unlike traditional note-taking tools, this system operates on two levels:

- **Surface Level**: Clean, familiar interface for immediate productivity
- **Intelligence Layer**: AI-powered organization, relationship mapping, and context-aware suggestions working invisibly

The result is a knowledge base that grows smarter and more valuable as the project evolves.

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### Dual-Layer Architecture

**1. Markdown Discovery & Integration Layer**

- Automatic codebase scanning for existing `.md` files
- Real-time file system monitoring
- Git-friendly virtual organization (no file moves)
- External configuration via `.notes-categories.json`

**2. Knowledge Intelligence Layer**

- Semantic relationship mapping
- Context-aware categorization
- Decision impact tracking
- Pattern recognition and reuse

### File Organization Strategies

**Native File Organization Mode**

- Files remain in original locations (`/docs`, `/src`, etc.)
- Virtual categories overlay without disrupting project structure
- Respects existing team conventions and tooling
- Zero git conflicts from file reorganization

**Category-First View Mode**

- Knowledge organized by semantic categories
- Fast access regardless of physical file location
- Intelligent grouping by project phases and domains
- Search and filter across all organizational dimensions

**Hybrid Mode** (Recommended)

- Combines benefits of both approaches
- Maintains file system awareness with semantic overlay
- Adaptable interface based on user context and preferences
