### Context Intelligence Indicators

**Real-time Status Indicators**:

- **● (Active)**: Live work in progress or high activity
- **Context Percentages**: AI handoff readiness (94%, 89%, etc.)
- **Progress Bars**: Agent work completion (█████▓░)
- **Smart Badges**: Counts with intelligence (15 ready, 3 high-context)
- **Health Colors**: 🟢 Good, 🟡 Attention needed, 🔴 Critical, ⚠️ Warning

## Design Principles & Human-AI Collaboration

### 1. Context Intelligence First

**Why It Matters:** Perfect AI handoffs require complete project understanding
**Solution:** Context quality scores (94%) and AI readiness indicators throughout sidebar
**Benefit:** Zero re-explanation overhead, seamless human → AI task handoffs

### 2. Human Orchestration Centered

**Why It Matters:** Humans excel at strategy, AI excels at execution with proper context
**Solution:** "Right Now" prioritizes human direction, AI status integrated unobtrusively  
**Benefit:** Strategic focus preserved, AI execution monitoring without interruption

### 3. Progressive Context Disclosure

**Why It Matters:** Avoid overwhelming users while providing intelligent depth when needed
**Solution:** Simple defaults (Working On) with smart expansion (Context: 94%, Agent status)
**Benefit:** Immediate productivity with advanced features revealed contextually

### 4. Cognitive Comfort Optimization

**Why It Matters:** Maximum 2-3 options per section prevents decision paralysis  
**Solution:** Human-centered language + intelligent indicators ("My Work" not "User Tasks")
**Benefit:** Emotional comfort with powerful context intelligence beneath the surface

### 5. Multi-Agent Coordination Intelligence

**Why It Matters:** Managing multiple AI agents (Claude, Research, Cursor) requires unified interface
**Solution:** "AI Helper" shows agent status, context synchronization, and coordination
**Benefit:** Parallel AI productivity without context loss or agent coordination overhead

### 6. Living Context Evolution

**Why It Matters:** Project context must compound and improve over time
**Solution:** "Context & Notes" with living connections, decision tracking, pattern recognition
**Benefit:** Every collaboration enriches project intelligence for better future handoffs

### 7. Flow State Preservation

**Why It Matters:** Context switching breaks deep work and strategic thinking
**Solution:** All context preserved across navigation, background AI monitoring
