## 📋 Overview

Our release process follows the versioning strategy outlined in [Versioning Strategy](./versioning-strategy.md), supporting **manual prerelease flows** and **manual production releases** using semantic versioning with the following progression:

```
Beta (Manual) → Release Candidate (Manual) → Production (Manual)
v1.50.0-beta.1 → v1.50.0-rc.1 → v1.50.0
```

### 🎯 Release Types

| Type           | Pattern          | Purpose                | Trigger |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| **Beta**       | `v1.50.0-beta.1` | Development testing    | Manual  |
| **RC**         | `v1.50.0-rc.1`   | Pre-production testing | Manual  |
| **Production** | `v1.50.0`        | Live environment       | Manual  |
| **Hotfix**     | `v1.50.1`        | Critical fixes         | Manual  |

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For New Team Members:

1. **Develop**: Work on feature branches, merge PRs to master branches
2. **Beta Testing**: Create manual beta versions for testing in Dev environment
3. **RC Creation**: Use GitHub Actions when ready for broader testing
4. **Production**: Use GitHub Actions for final release

### For Release Managers:

1. **Create**: Manually create beta versions using Release Beta Version workflow
2. **Test**: Validate features in Dev environment
3. **Promote**: Create RC when beta is stable
4. **Release**: Create production version after RC testing

---

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### ✅ Backward Compatibility:

- All existing release workflows remain functional
- No breaking changes to current processes
- Beta flow is now manual for better control

### 🎯 Benefits:

- **Controlled releases**: Manual beta creation prevents unwanted releases
- **Better testing**: Clear Dev → PPE → PROD progression
- **Safer releases**: Multiple validation stages
- **Consistent versioning**: Automated semantic versioning
- **Flexible increment types**: Choose exactly how to increment versions

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Problem**: Version bump fails

```bash
# Solution: Check package.json and VERSION file sync
git status
git checkout -- package.json VERSION
```

**Problem**: Release notes are empty

```bash
# Solution: Check commit history and format
git log --oneline HEAD~10..HEAD
# Ensure commits follow conventional format
```

**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow fails

```bash
# Solution: Check workflow permissions and branch protection
# Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has write permissions
```

**Beta not auto-bumping?**

- Check that PR was merged to `develop` branch
- Verify `.github/workflows/release-beta.yml` is enabled

**Release workflow failing?**

- Ensure you have admin permissions
- Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions

**Version validation errors?**

- Review semantic versioning rules above
- Use local testing scripts to validate

### **Emergency Procedures**

**Critical Hotfix Process:**

1. Create hotfix branch immediately
2. Apply minimal fix
3. Skip normal review process (with approval)
4. Deploy directly to production
5. Follow up with proper documentation

**Rollback Process:**

1. Identify last known good version
2. Revert deployment to previous tag
3. Create hotfix for any critical issues
4. Plan proper fix for next release

### Getting Help:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Test locally with provided scripts
3. Review this documentation
4. Contact the release team
