- **Monetization**: Free tier must provide core value, premium features for advanced AI
- **Compliance**: Local-first approach addresses privacy concerns, GDPR-ready

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Product Decisions

1. **Active Task Detection**: Should we support multiple "in-progress" tasks or enforce single focus?

   - **Recommendation**: Single active task for MVP, multiple tasks in Phase 2
   - **Rationale**: Aligns with decision paralysis elimination goal

2. **Time Tracking Granularity**: Automatic vs. manual session management?

   - **Recommendation**: Automatic detection with manual override option
   - **Rationale**: Reduces friction while providing user control

3. **AI Integration Depth**: Start with simple context export or build deep integrations?
   - **Recommendation**: Simple export for MVP, API integrations in Phase 3
   - **Rationale**: Faster time to market, validate core value first

### Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: Extend existing stores or create separate working-on store?

   - **Recommendation**: Create focused workingOnStore with dataStore integration
   - **Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns, easier testing and maintenance

2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or file system polling for CLI sync?

   - **Recommendation**: File system polling for MVP, WebSocket optimization later
   - **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, existing patterns in codebase

3. **Focus Mode Implementation**: Overlay approach or dedicated route?
   - **Recommendation**: UI state toggle within same component
   - **Rationale**: Maintains context, smoother transitions, less routing complexity
