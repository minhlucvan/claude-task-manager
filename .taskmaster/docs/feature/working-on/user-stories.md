# Working On Page - User Stories

## Context & Strategic Importance

Based on our research and user feedback, the most significant productivity killer for AI-assisted developers is **decision paralysis** when starting work sessions. The "Working On" page solves this by providing instant clarity on the current priority, maintaining context across AI tool sessions, and preserving flow state.

**Key Strategic Goals:**

- Transform task management from overwhelming to empowering
- Eliminate context switching overhead in AI-powered workflows
- Create emotional comfort and satisfaction in daily work
- Support both deep focus coding and AI-assisted development

## Target Users & Personas

### Primary Persona: "The Flow State Developer"

**Demographics:**

- Individual developer or small team lead
- Uses AI tools daily (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code)
- Values deep focus sessions and productivity
- Struggles with context switching and decision fatigue

**Pain Points:**

- Starts each day wondering "what should I work on?"
- Loses context between AI conversation sessions
- Gets overwhelmed by long task lists and project complexity
- Wastes mental energy on task prioritization instead of building

**Goals:**

- Instant clarity on what to work on
- Maintained context across tool switches
- Progress visibility and sense of accomplishment
- Minimal cognitive overhead for task management

**Behavioral Patterns:**

- Opens development tools in the morning and wants immediate direction
- Switches between AI coding assistants and needs context preservation
- Works in focused sessions with minimal interruptions
- Values tools that "just work" without configuration overhead

### Secondary Persona: "The AI-Enhanced Builder"

**Demographics:**

- Startup founder or indie developer
- Heavy user of AI code generation
- Building products rapidly with minimal team
- Focuses on shipping over process

**Pain Points:**

- AI conversations restart from zero each session
- Loses track of architectural decisions and context
- Needs to balance building with project coordination
- Overwhelmed by traditional project management complexity

**Goals:**

- AI that remembers project context
- Simple task management that doesn't get in the way
- Focus on building products, not managing processes
- Seamless workflow across development tools
