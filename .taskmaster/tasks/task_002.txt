# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Task Master CLI Integration Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive Node.js integration layer with Next.js API routes to interface with .taskmaster directory structure and execute CLI commands programmatically
# Details:
Build robust API architecture with /api/tasks, /api/cli-execute, and /api/file-watch endpoints. Implement TypeScript interfaces (Task, Project, Config, Status) matching CLI data structures. Create file system watchers using chokidar for real-time synchronization. Integrate child_process for CLI command execution with proper error handling, timeout management, and response parsing. Implement WebSocket connections for live updates and bidirectional sync between UI state and CLI files. Include security measures: input validation, command sanitization, and file path restrictions. Support optimistic updates with rollback on CLI failures, batch operations for multiple task updates, and conflict resolution for concurrent modifications.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing suite including: Unit tests for file operations with temporary directories, integration tests with actual .taskmaster files, mocked CLI responses for reliable testing. Test child_process integration, WebSocket connections, file system permissions, JSON parsing/validation, and network connectivity. Load testing with large task lists (1000+ tasks) and performance optimization validation. Security testing for command injection and file path traversal vulnerabilities.

# Subtasks:
