# Task ID: 7
# Title: Build PRD Parsing and Project Setup Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create intuitive interface for uploading PRDs, parsing them with AI, and generating initial task structures
# Details:
Implement drag-and-drop file upload for PRD documents (.txt, .md, .pdf). Build AI-powered parsing interface that calls task-master parse-prd functionality. Create project setup wizard with template selection. Implement task generation preview before committing. Add project metadata management and configuration options. Support both new projects and appending to existing ones.

# Test Strategy:
Test file upload functionality, PRD parsing accuracy with sample documents, task generation verification, project creation workflow. Test with various PRD formats and sizes.
