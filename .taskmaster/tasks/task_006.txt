# Title: Develop Multi-Agent Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create agent orchestration interface for managing multiple AI agents working on the same project
# Details:
Build agent management dashboard showing active agents, their specializations, and current tasks. Implement agent creation/configuration UI with role assignment. Create task distribution algorithm to assign tasks to appropriate agents. Build agent communication protocol for inter-agent coordination. Implement conflict resolution for overlapping agent work.
