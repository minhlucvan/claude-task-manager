Query root type includes 14 operations covering all task management (tasks, task, searchTasks, readyTasks), CLI operations (cliHistory, cliCommand, cliStatus), sync operations (syncOperations, syncOperation, syncStatus, syncConflicts, syncHealth), and basic health endpoints (health, hello). Mutation root type includes 11 operations providing full CRUD functionality (createTask, updateTask, deleteTask), CLI execution (executeCLICommand, killCLIProcess, clearCLIHistory), sync management (updateTaskStatus, createBatchOperation, resolveSyncConflict, forceSync), and testing (ping). All operations properly accept filter, pagination, and ordering parameters where appropriate. Schema introspection confirms all operations are accessible with correct argument types and return types. Operations successfully execute (tested with ping mutation returning 'pong'). Root types fully implement all requirements from task description plus additional comprehensive functionality. Ready for subtask 14.5 (GraphQL Code Generator configuration).\n</info added on 2025-07-26T12:12:31.643Z>",
