> **Claude Task Manager** is an AI-powered project management interface that remembers your entire project context. Built on [Claude Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master), it provides a visual dashboard for managing AI development projects with Claude, GPT, and other LLMs. Perfect for developers using Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI coding assistant.

## The problem every AI developer knows

It's 9 AM. You open Claude.

_"So I'm building a..."_

**Stop. You explained this yesterday. And the day before.**

That database decision from last week? Lost in tab #7. The refactoring plan? Gone.

Every conversation starts from zero.

## What we built

**Your AI project manager that never forgets**

<!-- <img src="./public/screenshot-dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard showing tasks, terminal, and docs side by side" /> -->

No more explaining context. No more lost decisions. Just building.

Your vision stays intact from day 1 to launch.

## How it works

### Quick start for any project

```bash
# One command to set up everything
npx claude-task-manager init

# Start the UI
npx claude-task-manager start
```

Opens in your browser. That's it.

### What happens:

1. **`init`** ‚Üí Sets up project management skeleton (tasks, docs, config)
2. **`start`** ‚Üí Launches the UI in your browser
3. **Use normally** ‚Üí Claude Task Master CLI still works as usual

### Or try the demo first

```bash
# Clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/minhlucvan/claude-task-manager.git
cd claude-task-manager
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## What makes this different

**üè† Your computer, your data**  
No cloud BS. Everything runs locally. Export anytime.

**üéØ Personal first**  
Built for individual developers. Team features come later, when YOU need them.

**üöÄ Ship first, process later**  
We help you build, not plan. Minimal setup, maximum output.

## Vibe Coding Philosophy

**Flow state development.** You know that feeling at 3 AM when everything clicks? When you're in the zone and shipping features without friction? That's vibe coding.

Most tools break your flow. Context switching kills creativity. But when your AI remembers everything and your workspace stays consistent, you can code for hours without interruption.

**This is your 3 AM coding companion.** Built by developers who understand that the best code happens when you're not fighting your tools.

### Claude Code Integration

Perfect companion for Claude Code users:

- **Persistent context** - Your Claude conversations remember your entire project
- **Seamless workflow** - Terminal, tasks, and AI chat in one interface
- **Flow preservation** - No more explaining your architecture every session
- **3 AM ready** - Dark mode, minimal distractions, maximum focus

## For existing projects

Already have Claude Task Master set up? Just run:

```bash
npx claude-task-manager start
```

The UI will use your existing tasks and configuration.

## Features that actually matter

‚úÖ **Project memory** - Your AI never forgets decisions, context, or progress  
‚úÖ **Vision alignment** - Every AI conversation knows your project goals  
‚úÖ **Intelligent roadmap** - Knows what matters for YOUR specific project  
‚úÖ **3 AM companion** - Terminal, docs, tasks - everything right there when inspiration hits  
‚úÖ **Your data, your control** - Local first, works offline, export anytime

## Who this is for

- **Vibe coders** who do their best work when the world is asleep
- **Claude Code power users** ready to supercharge their workflow
- **Flow state developers** who hate context switching
- **3 AM builders** who need AI that doesn't forget by morning
- **Solo founders** tired of explaining their vision 10 times a day
- **Anyone** with "architecture_decision_final_v2_ACTUALFINAL.txt" somewhere

## Status

Early but working. Built on rock-solid Claude Task Master. Things will change based on what people actually need.

## Coming next

- Better task filtering
- Connected docs that evolve with your project
- Multi-agent workflows
- **Sync with GitHub Projects/Trello** - Keep your PM tools updated automatically
