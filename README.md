## The problem every AI developer knows

It's 9 AM. You open Claude.

_"So I'm building a..."_

**Stop. You explained this yesterday. And the day before.**

That database decision from last week? Lost in tab #7. The refactoring plan? Gone.

Every conversation starts from zero.

## What we built

**Your AI project manager that never forgets**

<!-- <img src="./public/screenshot-dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard showing tasks, terminal, and docs side by side" /> -->

No more explaining context. No more lost decisions. Just building.

Your vision stays intact from day 1 to launch.

## How it works

### Quick start for any project

```bash
# One command to set up everything
npx claude-task-manager init

# Start the UI
npx claude-task-manager start
```

Opens in your browser. That's it.

### What happens:

1. **`init`** → Sets up project management skeleton (tasks, docs, config)
2. **`start`** → Launches the UI in your browser
3. **Use normally** → Claude Task Master CLI still works as usual

### Or try the demo first

```bash
# Clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/minhlucvan/claude-task-manager.git
cd claude-task-manager
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## What makes this different

**🏠 Your computer, your data**  
No cloud BS. Everything runs locally. Export anytime.

**🎯 Personal first**  
Built for individual developers. Team features come later, when YOU need them.

**🚀 Ship first, process later**  
We help you build, not plan. Minimal setup, maximum output.

## For existing projects

Already have Claude Task Master set up? Just run:

```bash
npx claude-task-manager start
```

The UI will use your existing tasks and configuration.

## Features that actually matter

✅ **Project memory** - Your AI never forgets decisions, context, or progress  
✅ **Vision alignment** - Every AI conversation knows your project goals  
✅ **Intelligent roadmap** - Knows what matters for YOUR specific project  
✅ **3 AM companion** - Terminal, docs, tasks - everything right there when inspiration hits  
✅ **Your data, your control** - Local first, works offline, export anytime

## Who this is for

- **Night owl developers** who need their AI to keep up at 3 AM
- **Solo founders** tired of explaining their vision 10 times a day
- **AI power users** with "architecture_decision_final_v2_ACTUALFINAL.txt" somewhere
- **Anyone** who's ever thought "I swear I solved this last week..."

## Status

Early but working. Built on rock-solid Claude Task Master. Things will change based on what people actually need.

## Coming next

- Better task filtering
- Connected docs that evolve with your project
- Multi-agent workflows
- **Sync with GitHub Projects/Trello** - Keep your PM tools updated automatically
- Whatever you need (seriously, [tell us](https://github.com/minhlucvan/claude-task-manager/discussions))

## Contributing
