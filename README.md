> **Claude Task Manager** is a personal project management interface powered by AI agents that remembers your entire project context. Built on [Claude Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master), it provides seamless integration with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and other development tools. Perfect for solo developers who want AI agents that coordinate across their entire workflow.

## The problem every AI developer knows

It's 9 AM. You open Claude.

_"So I'm building a..."_

**Stop. You explained this yesterday. And the day before.**

That database decision from last week? Lost in tab #7. The refactoring plan? Gone.

Every conversation starts from zero.

## What we built

**Your AI project manager that never forgets**

<!-- <img src="./public/screenshot-dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard showing tasks, terminal, and docs side by side" /> -->

No more explaining context. No more lost decisions. Just building.

Your vision stays intact from day 1 to launch.

## How it works

### Quick start for any project

```bash
# One command to set up everything
npx claude-task-manager init

# Start the UI
npx claude-task-manager start
```

Opens in your browser. That's it.

### What happens:

1. **`init`** ‚Üí Sets up project management skeleton (tasks, docs, config)
2. **`start`** ‚Üí Launches the UI in your browser
3. **Use normally** ‚Üí Claude Task Master CLI still works as usual

### Or try the demo first

```bash
# Clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/minhlucvan/claude-task-manager.git
cd claude-task-manager
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## What makes this different

**‚ö° Minimal setup, maximum results**  
One command gets you coding. No complex configurations, no learning curves, no BS. From `npx claude-task-manager init` to shipping features in under 2 minutes.

**üéØ Personal productivity ‚Üí Team collaboration**  
Master your own workflow first. When you're ready to scale, seamlessly invite your team. Personal excellence drives team success.

**üè† Local first, integration ready**  
Your data stays on your machine. Your workflow stays fast. Connect to cloud tools when it makes sense, not because you have to.

**üöÄ Ship products, not processes**  
You're the PM giving vision and requirements. AI agents review, implement, and ship. Focus on what matters: building things people want, not managing endless meetings about building things.

**üí° Smart by default, simple by design**  
Advanced AI orchestration that feels effortless. Multiple agents coordinate behind the scenes while you stay in flow. Intelligence without complexity.

## Vibe Coding Philosophy

**Flow state development.** You know that feeling when everything clicks? Whether it's 3 AM, 6 AM, or your peak focus time - when you're in the zone and shipping features without friction? That's vibe coding.

Most tools break your flow. Context switching kills creativity. But when your AI remembers everything and your workspace stays consistent, you can code for hours without interruption.

**This is your deep focus coding companion.** Built by developers who understand that the best code happens when you're not fighting your tools.

### Claude Code Integration

Perfect companion for Claude Code users:

- **Persistent context** - Your Claude conversations remember your entire project
- **Seamless workflow** - Terminal, tasks, and AI chat in one interface
- **Flow preservation** - No more explaining your architecture every session
- **Focus-optimized** - Dark mode, minimal distractions, maximum productivity

## For existing projects

Already have Claude Task Master set up? Just run:

```bash
npx claude-task-manager start
```

The UI will use your existing tasks and configuration.

## Features that actually matter

‚úÖ **AI agent orchestration** - Coordinate multiple AI models across your entire workflow  
‚úÖ **Personal project memory** - Your AI agents never forget decisions, context, or progress  
‚úÖ **Seamless tool integration** - Works with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and your favorite tools  
‚úÖ **Solo developer optimized** - Built specifically for individual productivity, not teams  
‚úÖ **Deep focus companion** - Terminal, docs, tasks - everything right there when inspiration hits  
‚úÖ **Your data, your control** - Local first, works offline, export anytime

## Who this is for

- **Vibe coders** who do their best work when the world is asleep
- **Claude Code power users** ready to supercharge their workflow
- **Flow state developers** who hate context switching
- **Night owl builders** who need AI that doesn't forget by morning
- **Solo founders** tired of explaining their vision 10 times a day
- **Anyone** with "architecture_decision_final_v2_ACTUALFINAL.txt" somewhere

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status: Under Active Development

**Heads up!** This project is moving fast and breaking things (in the good way):

- üöß **Expect breaking changes** - We're iterating rapidly based on community feedback
- üîß **Things may break** - Features get refactored, APIs change, workflows evolve
- üöÄ **Ship fast, fix faster** - Following the vibe coding philosophy of iteration over perfection
- ‚úÖ **Core is solid** - Built on rock-solid Claude Task Master foundation

**Translation**: Perfect for vibe coders who love living on the edge, maybe not for production mission-critical stuff (yet).
