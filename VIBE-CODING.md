# The Vibe Coding Manifesto

> _"The best code is written when the world is quiet."_

## What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe coding** isn't just coding late at night. It's about finding and maintaining that perfect flow state where everything clicks - your mind, your tools, your AI, your environment.

It's 3 AM. No meetings. No Slack notifications. Just you, your code, and pure creative flow.

## The Philosophy

### üåô **Embrace the Night**

- Peak creativity happens when distractions fade
- Night owl developers know: the best features ship at 3 AM
- Quiet hours = deep work hours

### üéØ **Flow Over Process**

- Tools that enhance flow, not break it
- Context that persists across sessions
- AI that remembers your vision
- Zero friction between thought and code

### üß† **Context is King**

- Your AI should remember what you built yesterday
- Architectural decisions shouldn't live in random text files
- Every conversation should build on the last
- Your workspace should feel like home

### ‚ö° **Ship, Don't Plan**

- Perfect is the enemy of shipped
- MVPs over masterpieces
- Iteration over perfection
- Building over meetings

## The 3 AM Test

A good vibe coding setup passes the **3 AM Test**:

1. **Can you resume work instantly?** No hunting for context, no "what was I doing?"
2. **Does your AI remember your project?** No re-explaining architecture every session
3. **Are you fighting your tools?** Smooth workflows, minimal friction
4. **Can you stay in flow for hours?** Everything you need, right where you need it

## The Community

Vibe coding isn't just a workflow - it's a mindset shared by developers who:

- üåô Do their best work when the world sleeps
- üéØ Value deep focus over constant communication
- üß† Understand that context is everything
- ‚ö° Ship code that matters
- ü§ù Help other night owls find their flow

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment** for distraction-free coding
2. **Use AI tools** that remember your context
3. **Embrace the quiet hours** - find your peak flow time
4. **Build systems** that preserve your mental state
5. **Share your journey** - inspire other vibe coders
